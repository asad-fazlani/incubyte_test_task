# String Calculator

This project is a solution to the **String Calculator** kata using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** in Ruby. The goal of this project is to build a simple string calculator that handles different delimiters, newlines, and raises errors for negative numbers.

## Requirements

- Ruby 3.0.0 or later
- Bundler (to install dependencies)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asad-fazlani/incubyte_test_task.git
   cd incubyte_test_task

2. Install the required gems using Bundler:

   ```bash
   bundle install
 Once the gems are installed, you're ready to run tests and use the calculator.

3. Running Tests
 To run the tests using RSpec, execute the following command:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rspec
 This will run all the test cases and ensure that everything is working correctly.
